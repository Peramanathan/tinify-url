[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Peramanathan/tinify-url/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Peramanathan/tinify-url/latest)

### Tasks and Requirements
The assignment is to use Python and a web framework to create a URL shortener similar to `http://bit.ly​`, but with a different URL encoding scheme. The shortened URLs will have the form `http://myurlshortener.com/​<word>/` where 
`<word>`` is a word from the english language. 

- [x] Make sure to fulfill all the requirements stated in this document. 
- [x] You must use Python to complete this assignment. You may use any frameworks and libraries you want to. 
- [x] Focus on writing clean, good looking and easily understandable code.  
- [x] At Fyndiq it is more important to write robust, easily readable and correct code than to do 
it quickly, so please pay attention to detail and corner cases. 
- [x] Provide a README with instructions on how to install and run the code in a contained environment, assuming that the computer that is to run the assignment does not have any frameworks or libraries installed. 
- [x] Use sqlite for database, and you could attach the database file with the finished code so that it is easier to run it. 
- [x] Make tests (unit tests and/or integration tests) for your code.


### Running the app
 
1. `git clone https://github.com/Peramanathan/tinify-url.git`
2. `cd tiny-url`
3. `virtualenv tinyurl-env`   [`sudo pip install virtualenv` if virtualenv not installed before]
4. `source tinyurl-env/bin/activate`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  [one time only]
6. `python tinify.py`
7. Open `localhost:5000` in browser
8. Feed your url such as `techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/gmail-we-need-to-talk/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&utm_content=FaceBook&sr_share=facebook` 
9. You will get `http://myurlshortener.com/<word>` where `word` in 
```['10', '11', '2015', '28techcrunch', '29', '3a', 'campaign', 'com', 'content', 'crunch', 'facebook', 'facebook', 'feed', 'feed', 'feedburner', 'gmail', 'medium', 'ncid', 'need', 'rss', 'share', 'source', 'sr', 'talk', 'techcrunch', 'to', 'utm', 'utm', 'utm', 'utm', 'we']``` or prefix/suffix of them or random if all of them already allocated or oldest keyword if all the keys were assigned already
10. Visit `http://myurlshortener.com/<word>` you will be redirected to the url
you just feed, in case if you run this in development environment visit `http://localhost:5000/<word>`


### Running the test

- Simply run : `python tinify_tests.py`

### TODO list

- [] Adopt ORM for database models (tables)
- [] Refactor, simplify, divide into mulitiple files
- [] Cleaned and simple tests file
- [] Frontpage aesthification
- [x] More test cases
